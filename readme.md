In this project, I developed a simulation of the spread of a disease through a population using a Markov chain model. The model allows us to explore how different factors, such as the spread rate, the recovery rate, the vaccination rate, and the immunity rate, impact the evolution of the disease over time.

To use the model, i first define the initial state of the disease (the proportion of the population that is infected) and the transition function, which determines how the disease spreads and recovers over time. i can then simulate the evolution of the disease through a specified number of steps and step size using the simulate() method of the MarkovChain class.

I can also visualize the simulation results by plotting the evolution of the disease over time. In addition to the state of the disease, i can also plot a second variable (such as the proportion of the population that has been vaccinated) to see how it evolves alongside the disease.

To summarize, this project provides a tool for simulating the spread of a disease through a population and visualizing the results, which can be useful for understanding the impact of different factors on the evolution of the disease and for exploring potential strategies for controlling its spread.




Markov chains are a type of mathematical model that can be used to describe the evolution of systems that change over time. In a Markov chain model, the system is assumed to be in one of a finite number of states at any given time, and the probability of transitioning from one state to another is fixed over time.

One of the key features of Markov chains is that they are memoryless: the probability of transitioning from one state to another depends only on the current state of the system, and not on its past history. This means that the future evolution of the system can be predicted based solely on its current state, which makes Markov chains a useful tool for modeling systems that change over time.

In the context of this project, i use a Markov chain model to simulate the spread of a disease through a population. The state of the system at any given time is the proportion of the population that is infected, and the transition function determines the probability of transitioning from one state (e.g. a given proportion of the population being infected) to another (e.g. a different proportion of the population being infected) based on factors such as the spread rate, the recovery rate, the vaccination rate, and the immunity rate.
